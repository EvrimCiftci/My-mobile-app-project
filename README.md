# My-mobile-app-project


My quiz app will be an interactive and educational quiz experience with focus on geography. Users will 
encounter flags from different parts of the earth and will be asked to define each country’s capital. The 
main point of the app is to offer an fun way to learn and improve people’s general culture, especially 
focused on children , to enrich their understanding of geography. There’re people all around the world 
who may lack of knowledge about countries outside of their own country, this app will try to solve this 
problem and close the knowledge gap by presenting easy and accessible learning app. Users will be able 
to see their progress and performance at the end of the quiz so it’ll display user’s score and inspire them 
to do better every time.
